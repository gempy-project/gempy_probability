# TODO:

--- General
- [ ] Create a proper suit of tests
  - [ ] Keep extracting code into modules and functions 
  - [ ] Posterior analysis for gempy 
- [ ] Investigate speed
- [ ] Investigate segmentation function 
- [ ] Create a robust api to make sure we do not mess up assigning priors to gempy parameters
- [ ] do we need to use index_put or just normal indexing?
--- Vector examples
- [ ] Bring the Vector example here...
- [ ] Using categories as likelihood function (maybe I need to check out with Sam)
--- MinEye
- [ ] Revive magnetics
- [ ] Add Simon's example


### Possible Design:
- Geological Model
- Priors
- Likelihood
----
- Having a runner or something like that?
