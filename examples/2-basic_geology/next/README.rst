Correlations
````````````

Furthermore, keep in mind that the inference happens in a multidimensional manifold---although for obvious visualization reasons we display each parameter independently. This means that although in the previous figures the posterior distributions seem independent, a closer examination---e.g. joint plots---uncovers correlation in the parameters.

   Correlations between parameters can be uncovered with joint plots.
