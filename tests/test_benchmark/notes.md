- Running 250 iterations took 28 sec. This is 8.81 it/s
- The number of gempy evaluations are:
  - 53 evals/s or 18 ms per eval
  - 6 evals per iteration
- More than 53 gempy evaluations per second seem hard to improve
- Wait till I have a likelihood with a bigger model and a likelihood function that needs
 big grids (i.e.) gravity
